# Recycling
Mod where you can recycle items and buildings

### Usage
Alt + Right-click on an item or building.
For items that already have an action assigned to this hotkey (for example, a Tent), first pick up the item and then use Alt + Right-click on it in the inventory.

### Configuration
- Chance to recover raw materials (initial ingredients). This chance is applied individually to each ingredient of the item.
- Experience affects the chance of recovering the initial ingredients.
- When recycling, you will receive the ore ingredient instead of the ingot.

### Game balance impact
Depends on the configuration.
If the chance of recovering raw materials is low, the overall impact on game balance will also be low.

### Details
This mod adds a new action: recycling composite items and buildings—those that must be crafted from initial ingredients.

When an item or building (in crate form) is recycled:
- It disappears.
- There is a chance to recover the original ingredients used to craft it.

Additional rules:
- Food cannot be recycled.
- For items involving living beings, the chance to recover the living being is 100% (e.g. a hamster).

### Example
Use Alt + Right-click on a club lying on the ground.
A Diggle will perform the recycling action. The club will disappear, and all the original ingredients required to craft it will appear on the ground (assuming the recovery chance is set to 100% in the configuration).
